# Add_Items_Project
I developed an automation script for a shopping website that streamlines the user experience from adding items to checkout and final purchase. 
Utilizing Selenium with Python, I implemented the following features:

Item Selection: Automated the process of selecting and adding items to the shopping cart.
Checkout Process: Navigated through the checkout process, filling in necessary details and confirming the order.
Purchase Completion: Simulated the final purchase step, ensuring a smooth transaction flow.
This project not only demonstrates proficiency in web automation but also highlights the effectiveness of using Selenium for testing e-commerce functionalities. The script is built using the Page Object Model (POM), promoting maintainability and scalability for future enhancements.

Feel free to check out the code in my GitHub repository!
